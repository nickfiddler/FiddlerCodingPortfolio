I wanted to include this in my github because even though it is not perfect, it has some good qualities as a program and shows that there is always room for improvement. In the future, I will be adding to it to 1. Cleaning up the program and trying to shorten it a bit 2. Add splitting and doubling down to hit or stand option 3. Having the play function return a result rather than a print f string 4. Have a pot that you can make bets and the game not being over until you lose your pot or you say end the game 5. Maybe, making it an interactive with buttons and actually looking like a table"
