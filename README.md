# FiddlerCodingPortfolio
My name is Nick Fiddler. I recently graduated from Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania - Bloomsburg (formerly Bloomsburg University) as a Data Science major. I am creating this project to show off some of the coding/ machine learning skills and techniques that I have learned over time. For each project, I try to use a technique that fits the data the best which the knowledge is a skill within itself. Please enjoy going through waht projects I have done and please reach out if you have any questions!
