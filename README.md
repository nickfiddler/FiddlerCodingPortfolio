# FiddlerCodingPortfolio
My name is Nick Fiddler. I recently graduated from Commonwealth University of Pennsylvania - Bloomsburg (formerly Bloomsburg University) as a Data Science major. I am creating this project to show off some of the coding/ machine learning skills and techniques that I have learned over time. For each project, I try to demonstrate a machine learning technique or coding technique that investigates a particular interest of my own. Please enjoy going through what projects I have done and please reach out (npfiddler0617@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
